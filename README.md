This is the game Tic Tac Toe playable in the browser.

I originally made this in February 2017, then a few months later I made a version using HTML Canvas.

I'm returning now in 2025 to make some small changes, listed below:

- Added README
- Added [MIT License](./LICENSE)
- Updated `Fork Me on GitHub` button
- Fixed HTML typo

Otherwise, the project is in the same state that it was in 2017. All changes have been by hand without the use of AI (or formatting).
